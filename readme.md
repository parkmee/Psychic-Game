# Psychic Game
My very first app! It's not pretty, but it works. Letters of the alphabet are stored in array. A random letter is selected by the program once a key is pressed. Users have 9 chances to guess the correct letter using the keyboard. A win or loss is tallied and a corresponding gif is displayed. Validation rules exist to ensure letters are being guessed.

## Getting Started

Start the game by guessing a letter. You have 9 chances to get the right answer. Your score will be tallied at the end of the game!
